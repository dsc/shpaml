# SHPAML - A productive HTML generator (like HAML but in Python)

[SHPAML](http://shpaml.webfactional.com/) is a mini language that can help you to build web pages more quickly. It leverages familiar concepts from HTML and CSS, while striving to bring brevity and clarity to the primary documents that you edit. It plays nice with templating languages. It was written by Steve Howell.

This repo is a clone of the source available at [the SHPAML website](http://shpaml.webfactional.com/), with minor modifications by [Dave Schoonover](http://github.com/dsc) for `egg`ing. 

Please see the site for authorative info (like examples, docs, license, etc).
